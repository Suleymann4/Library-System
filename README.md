# Library-System

Introduction
In this assignment, you will develop a library management program to handle a collection of books. The main functionalities include adding books to the library, searching for a book by author, searching for a book by title and displaying the books sorted by the author's last name. If multiple books have the same author, they will be sorted by their titles. You will implement the insertion sort algorithm to sort the books, the binary search algorithm to search for a book by the author, and the linear search algorithm to search by title. This project aims to provide practice working with structs and vectors. You can utilize the algorithms provided in your lectures to complete this task.
